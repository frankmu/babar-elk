Core::
* [IndexPatterns] Support cross cluster search {pull}11114[#11114]
  - Index Patterns can now point to indices from remote clusters when using Elasticsearch's cross cluster search feature. After setting it up in elasticsearch, just mention the remote cluster alias in the index name like so: remoteCluster:indexName.
* Import / Export API for Dashboards {pull}10858[#10858]
* Disable dynamic/Implement static mappings {pull}10638[#10638]
* Adds an API for managing saved objects {pull}11632[#11632]
* Rely on `kbn-xsrf` header for CSRF protection {pull}12547[#12547]

Dev Tools::
* Improve Console screen-reader accessibility. {pull}11602[#11602]
* Adding autocomplete rules for reindex API to Console {pull}10150[#10150]

Dashboard::
* Introduce Clone feature in view mode {pull}10925[#10925]
  - Introducing the ability to easily clone dashboards in view mode.  Just click the new button in the top navigation, and enter in a new dashboard name.
* Update angular-bootstrap DatePicker with UI Framework classes. {pull}11378[#11378]
* Improve Dashboard screen-reader accessibility. {pull}11600[#11600]
* Improve accessibility of the Datepicker. {pull}11753[#11753]
* Add back dashboard descriptions {pull}11552[#11552]
  - In pre 5.0 versions of Kibana, we showed dashboard descriptions in theOpen listing, but the only place to edit or set them was in Saved Object Management. When we first introduced the new listing pages, we took out the dashboard description portion since the UI was pretty poor.  We've now added it back in, along with a more convenient place to add and edit the description for each dashboard.
* Hide the second toast when adding a new visualization straight from dashboard {pull}11621[#11621]
  - Previously using the Add new visualization button straight from dashboard caused two notifications to appear - one for successfully saving the visualization and one for successfully adding the visualization to the dashboard.  Two were unnecessary and since our notifications move elements around, we will now only show the notification about successfully saving the visualization.
* In case of a save error, use notify.error, not a full screen fatal page {pull}12381[#12381]

Discover::
* [context view] Apply filters to the context query {pull}11466[#11466]
  - This adds the ability to display a filter bar in the Context view and to apply those filters to the queries. It also modifies the link from the Discover view to the Context view to copy the currently defined filters when switching. New filters can be added from within the Context view using the icons in the expanded detail rows.
* Filter editors {pull}11375[#11375]
  - We've added more helpful input controls for editing filters. When you edit a filter, you'll get drop-downs and text boxes with suggestions from your data instead of just a JSON editor. We've also added the ability to add custom filters without having to click on a visualization.
* Improve Discover screen-reader accessibility: {pull}11598[#11598]
* Make Discover field chooser items keyboard accessible. {pull}11591[#11591]

* Improve Management screen-reader accessibility. {pull}11601[#11601]
* [Index pattern creation] Move the error message to below the input field {pull}11801[#11801]
* Removes the "Index contains time-based events" checkbox {pull}11409[#11409]

Visualize::
* Gauge Chart {pull}10336[#10336]
  - The gauge and goals charts are two new visualization types that allow people to track a metric and display the in context of a set of reference values. Gauges are useful to indicate how a metric compares to a range of threshold values, for example, to show whether a server load is within a normal range or instead has reach critical capacity. Goal visualizations are similar, but are primarily used to indicate how far a metric is removed from a certain target value.
* Region Map {pull}10937[#10937]
  - Kibana now has the Region Map Visualization. These are thematic maps in which boundary vector shapes are colored using a gradient, with higher intensity colors indicating larger values and lower intensity colors indicating smaller values. These are also known as choropleth maps. In order to color these layers, users specify a terms aggregation that matches a field in the vector layer. Kibana offers two vector layers by default; one for countries of the world and one for US Shapes. Users can also bring in their own vector layers by configuring the Kibana-configuration file to point to any GeoJson file that is hosted on a CORS-enabled server.
* Update illegible vis type icons with legible ones. {pull}11317[#11317]
* Improve Visualize screen-reader accessibility. {pull}11599[#11599]

=== Bug fixes
Design::

* [UI Framework] Fix React Warning in Demo Site {pull}11822[#11822]

Dashboard::
* [Fix for #10128] Adding an app for redirects when storing state in session storage {pull}10822[#10822]
* [Fix for #9747] Don't kill an entire dashboard because of one bad request {pull}11337[#11337]
  - Previously if a visualization caused a request error to be thrown, the entire dashboard would fail to load. We changed that so now the rest of the visualizations will continue to load successfully, helping you narrow down which visualizations the errors are coming from.
* [Fix for #11090] Fix bug in dashboard Add panel pager where it always said `x of x` {pull}11617[#11617]
  - There were a few places where the pager text would always say 'x of x' - the first number was always equal to the second. This fixes that and uses a style closer to the listing page pager style.
* [Fix for #11681] Fix modals in react {pull}11714[#11714]
* [Fix for #10588] Fix firefox scroll issue {pull}12031[#12031]
  - We fixed an issue that prevented scrolling inside panels that are too long, when using the Firefox browser.
* [Fix for #11078] Preserve the saved vis url when using the add new vis link from dashboard {pull}11932[#11932]
  - Previously using the Add new visualization link failed to set the correct last visited link for the app, so that navigating back to visualize would show you the same visualization, with the same title, but in an unsaved state. This could lead to confusion, as the only way to tell that you aren't modifying the visualization you just created is by looking at the url.  If you attempted to modify and save, you would get a duplicate title warning.  Now, you will correctly modify the existing visualization and the save will work seamlessly.
* [Fix for #12177] Remove encoding dashboard listing links {pull}12195[#12195]
